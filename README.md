# Description
This is a hacky Roslyn-based LSP server as an alternative to 
[omnisharp-roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

`csharp-ls` requires .NET 6 SDK to be installed. However it has been reported 
to work with projects using older versions of dotnet SDK, including .NET Core 3, 
.NET Framework 4.8 and possibly older ones too as it uses the standard
Roslyn/MSBuild libs that Visual Studio & omnisharp does.

## Features
- symbol rename;
- go-to-definition;
- find references;
- document/workspace symbol search;
- `textDocument/documentHighlight` support:
  - highlighting other symbol references in the document on hover;
- `codeAction/resolve` support for better performance when invoking code actions;
- go-to-definition in metadata support:
  - (needs integration from your LSP client -- `emacs-lsp/lsp-mode` has it.).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the list of recent improvements/fixes.

# Installation
`dotnet tool install --global csharp-ls`

See [csharp-ls nuget page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/csharp-ls/)

# Acknowledgements
- csharp-ls uses LSP interface from [Ionide.LanguageServerProtocol](https://github.com/ionide/LanguageServerProtocol);
- csharp-ls uses Roslyn to parse and update code; Roslyn maps really nicely to LSP w/relatively little impedance mismatch;
- csharp-ls uses [ILSpy/ICSharpCode.Decompiler](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) to decompile types in assemblies to C# source;
- csharp-ls is not affiliated with Microsoft Corp.

# TODO list
 - progress support;
 - `textDocument/signatureHelp` support for overload listing/selection
 - properly escape docxml text, e.g. backquote is a special character in markdown;
 - selection range provider
 - semantic tokens
 - ability to run tests
 - razorls integration (server-side)
 - analyzer support
 - code generator support
 - vscode plugin

# FAQ

## decompile for your editor , with the example of neovim

### api

The api is "csharp/metadata", in neovim ,you can request it like

```lua 
  local result, err = client.request_sync("csharp/metadata", params, 10000)
```

#### sender
You need to send a uri, it is like 

**csharp:/metadata/projects/trainning2/assemblies/System.Console/symbols/System.Console.cs**

In neovim, it will be result(s) from vim.lsp.handles["textDocument/definition"]

and the key of uri is the key, 

The key to send is like

```lua 
local params = {
	timeout = 5000,
	textDocument = {
		uri = uri,
	}
}
```

The key of textDocument is needed. And timeout is just for neovim. It is the same if is expressed by json.

### receiver

The object received is like 

```lua 
{
	projectName = "csharp-test",
	assemblyName = "System.Runtime",
	symbolName = "System.String",
	source = "using System.Buffers;\n ...."
}
```

And In neovim, You receive the "result" above, you can get the decompile source from 

```lua

local result, err = client.request_sync("csharp/metadata", params, 10000)
local source
if not err then
	source = result.result.source	
end
```

And there is a plugin of neovim for you to decompile it.
